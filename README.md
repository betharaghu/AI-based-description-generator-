# AI based decription generator 

two models were used  the first one will take any fashion image URL and generate an AI based description and the second model will predict the Material, pattern and neckline attribute 
for the same image URL input

for first model Resnet(https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/resnet_50/classification/1) 50 and LSTM(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM) is used 

for second model VGG 19(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/VGG19) is used
